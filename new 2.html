		  <p>In April 2011, during a football game a student was beaten by opposition team members and died a few hours later in hospital. The beaten student was from Mizoram and the three accused were Sudanese and Tanzanian.[22] The racial aspect of the crime led to near-rioting on the campus by students, destroying a number of kiosks and cars as well as blocking of the NH1 which attracted a huge media interest. Tension continued with the university closed for three days, and with police being pelted with stones by angry students.[23] LPU Pro-Chancellor Rashmi Mittal described the attack as, "students didnâ€™t take the spirit of the game in a positive manner".[24] The university's management have also been criticized for ignoring earlier and later racial attacks.[25]</p>
		  <p>In India, LPU is recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC),[6] the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)[7] and the Council of Architecture (COA)[8] and approved by the Pharmacy Council of India (PCI).[9] It is also a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU).[10]</p>
